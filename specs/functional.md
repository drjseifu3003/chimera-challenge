# Project Chimera: Autonomous Influencers System - Functional

## User Stories & Testing

### User Story 1 - Deploy Agent Swarm (Priority: P1)

As a network operator, I want to deploy and manage a swarm of autonomous influencer agents so that they can execute creative and economic tasks autonomously.

**Why this priority**: This is the core functionality enabling the system's primary purpose of managing autonomous influencers.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by deploying a swarm with objectives and verifying agents generate content and manage wallets independently, delivering autonomous operation value.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** objectives are set in the orchestrator, **When** swarm is deployed, **Then** agents begin executing tasks without human intervention.
2. **Given** an agent completes a task, **When** it requires resources, **Then** it pays using its crypto wallet.

### User Story 2 - Content Review (Priority: P2)

As a human reviewer, I want to review content generated by agents for safety and quality so that inappropriate content is prevented from publication.

**Why this priority**: Ensures safety and compliance in autonomous operations, critical for brand protection and legal requirements.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by submitting content for review and verifying approval/rejection based on policies, delivering safety assurance value.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** content with low confidence score (<0.70), **When** submitted for review, **Then** it is automatically rejected and retried.
2. **Given** content involving sensitive topics (politics, health, finance), **When** generated, **Then** it requires mandatory human review regardless of confidence.

### User Story 3 - Extend MCP Servers (Priority: P3)

As a developer, I want to extend MCP servers to add new tools and resources so that agents can interact with additional external systems.

**Why this priority**: Enables system extensibility and adaptation to new requirements, supporting long-term evolution.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by adding a new MCP tool and verifying agents can use it in tasks, delivering extensibility value.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a new MCP server is deployed, **When** agents poll resources, **Then** they access the new data sources.
2. **Given** a new tool is added, **When** agents need to perform an action, **Then** they call the new tool via MCP.

### Edge Cases

- What happens when an agent fails to pay for resources due to insufficient funds? System should pause operations and notify operators.
- How does system handle API failures in MCP interactions? Automatic retry with exponential backoff and self-healing triage.
- What happens when human reviewers are unavailable for high-volume content? System should queue content and alert operators.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST implement Hierarchical Swarm Architecture with Planner, Worker, Judge roles for task coordination
- **FR-002**: System MUST integrate with MCP for all external interactions, decoupling reasoning from implementation
- **FR-003**: System MUST implement HITL safety framework with confidence thresholds (high >0.90 auto-approve, medium 0.70-0.90 async approval, low <0.70 reject)
- **FR-004**: System MUST provide economic agency with non-custodial crypto wallets for each agent
- **FR-005**: System MUST support scalable deployment of thousands of agents using Kubernetes
- **FR-006**: System MUST use hybrid storage model (Weaviate for semantic memory, PostgreSQL for transactional data, Redis for episodic cache)

## Success Criteria

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: System supports deployment and management of 1000 concurrent agents
- **SC-002**: 95% of tasks complete without requiring human intervention
- **SC-003**: Content generation meets quality and safety standards in 90% of cases
- **SC-004**: System processes 10,000 tasks per hour at peak load
- **SC-005**: Agents successfully execute economic transactions (payments, negotiations) in 99% of cases
