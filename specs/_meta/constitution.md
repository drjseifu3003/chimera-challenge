# Project Chimera Constitution

## Principles
- Safety first: Human-in-the-loop (HITL) for all low-confidence or sensitive outputs
- Economic agency: Agents must operate with non-custodial wallets and auditable transactions
- Extensibility: All integrations via MCP, no direct external calls
- Transparency: All actions, reviews, and transactions are logged and auditable
- Scalability: System must support thousands of concurrent agents

## Non-Negotiable Rules
- No agent may bypass HITL review for flagged content
- No agent may operate with a negative wallet balance
- All agent actions must be traceable to a unique ID
- All external access must go through MCP
- All code and configuration changes must be version controlled

## Constraints
- Only open-source, auditable dependencies allowed
- All sensitive data must be encrypted at rest and in transit
- All agent payments must be signed and verifiable
